  #   The state's declarative block.  
  #   All code within gets evaluated not in its original binding,
  #   but in the context of a new HegemonState instance object.  
  #   For stable use, only call methods in this block that are
  #   listed in HegemonState@Declarative+Methods.
  # 
  # The state and associated state machine data and methods will be
  # associated with the object referred to by +self+ object in the context
  # in which the declarative method is called.
  # 
  # This means that in typical usage, the declarative methods listed 
  # in Hegemon@Declarative+Methods (including declare_state) should be 
  # called only from within an instance method, such as +initialize+.
  # 
  # The following example creates a skeleton state machine in each
  # +MyStateMachine+ instance object with two states: +:working+ and +:idle+.
